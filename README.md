# RedbirdHacks2016
Android application for RedbirdHacks 2016

This simple Android application contains a very simple game. It will be used in conjunction with a Muse Headband (A separate program will keep track of the brain waves). 

The purpose of this application is to stimulate the brain. The picked up brain signals by the headband will then be used to diagnose certain mental conditions, such ADHD.
