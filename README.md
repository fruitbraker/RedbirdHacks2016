# RedbirdHacks2016
Android application for RedbirdHacks 2016

This simple Android application will consist a series of very simple game. It will be used in conjunction with a Muse Headband (A separate program will keep track of the brain waves). 

The purpose of this application is to stimulate the brain brain. The picked up brain signals by the headband will then be used to diagnose certain mental conditions, such ad ADHD.
